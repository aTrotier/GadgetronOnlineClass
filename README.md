# Gadgetron Online Course

This course is aimed at both new and experienced users of Gadgetron, covering basic reconstruction as well as the latest functionalities. The topics covered are intended for researchers in basic science and/or clinical research. During June 2020 we will host the “Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit”. Although initially scheduled to take place in Bordeaux, the COVID-19 situation made that impossible. We are instead hosting it online.

Organizers: David Hansen, Kristoffer Knudsen, Hui Xue, Oliver Joseph, Vinai Roopchansingh, John Derbyshire, Aurélien Trotier, Stanislas Rapacchi, Maxime Yon, Pierre Bour, Valéry Ozenne

The course is organised remotely and will be accessible in live via visio-conference. Connection procedures is available [here](live-session.md). Input from participants is key element to make this course interactive. In addition of the course and pratical course, participants will have the possibility to propose working in progress session on a MRI reconstruction topic. More information is available [here](interactive-session.md). Each participant needs to a computer running either Linux, OSX or Windows with the Gadgetron up and running. Installation procedures has been summarized [here](gt-installation.md).  

The Gadgetron Online Course is made of several modules that constitute together the scientific stack. Gadgetron made use of standard computing languages (C++, Cmake, CUDA, Python, Matlab) that are themselve calling hundreds of libraries/packages/functions. We won't cover everything in this short course, but you should get enough information to decide if your research can benefit from Gadgetron. And I bet it will likely do.

Since all participants are working at home on their own computer, we asked the participants to test their Ismrmrd and Gadgetron installation in advance. 
Detailed installation instructions are available [here](gt-installation.md).

Feel free to contact us and to post any inquiries on the gadegtron [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gadgetron)

## 1. Introduction courses (day 1 : June 11th 2020)

### 1.1 - Gadgetron, a high level overview introduction(14:00 -> 15:00 CEST)

This [lecture](introduction-part1.md) does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Gadgetron's most
noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the Gadgetron's capability and
usage.

### 1.3 - Basic reconstruction using Python  (16:00 -> 17:00 CEST)

The primary goal of this [lesson]( ) introduces the python gadget and the ismsmrd-python-toolboxes
 that contains various toolboxes dedicated to common issues. Its different submodules correspond to different
applications, such as fourier transfrom, coil sensitivity map estimation, grappa reconstruction, etc.
