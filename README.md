# GadgetronOnlineClass

During June 2020 we will host the “**GadgetronOnlineClass**”. Although initially scheduled to take place in Bordeaux as a Summer School, the COVID-19 situation made that impossible. We are instead hosting it online. 

This course is aimed at both new and experienced users of **Gadgetron**, covering basic reconstruction as well as the latest functionalities. The topics covered are intended for researchers in basic science and/or clinical research. The online course will also provide examples of how to use the vendor-agnostic **MRD** file format (formerly “**ISMRMRD**”) for your custom reconstructions.

The Gadgetron Online Course is made of several modules that constitute together the scientific stack. Gadgetron made use of standard computing languages (C++, Cmake, CUDA, Python, Matlab) that are themselve calling hundreds of libraries/packages/functions. We won't cover everything in this short course, but you should get enough information to decide if your research can benefit from Gadgetron. And I bet it will likely do.

For any questions, feel to contact us on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gadgetron) of Gagdetron or at gadgetron2020 /at/ sciencesconf.org

Organizers: David Hansen, Kristoffer Knudsen, Hui Xue, Oliver Josephs, Vinai Roopchansingh, John Derbyshire, Adrienne Campbell, Rajiv Ramasawmy, Aurélien Trotier, Stanislas Rapacchi, Maxime Yon, Pierre Bour, Valéry Ozenne

## 1. Introduction courses (day 1 : June 11th 2020)

### 1.1 - Gadgetron, a high level overview introduction(14:00 -> 14:30 CEST)

This [lecture](introduction-part1.md) does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Gadgetron's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of Gadgetron's capability and usage.

**See also**:

 * [wiki](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/wiki/Gadgetron-Gadgets)

### 1.2 - Introduction (14:30 -> 15:30 CEST)

This [lecture](Coureses/Day1/Lecture2) is a Practical Introduction to Gadgetron. It takes a very hand-on approach to getting started with Gadgetron, aimed at giving new users the information they need to assemble and run their own reconstructions using Gadgetron.

This lecture will cover starting and running Gadgetron, controlling Gadgetron behaviour through configuration files, and provide a sensible introduction to a handful of very common Gadgets. 

**See also**:

 * [Gadgetron Hello World](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/wiki/Gadgetron-Hello-World)

### 1.3 - Hand's on session: Basic reconstruction using Python  (15:40 -> 17:00 CEST)

The primary goal of this [lecture](Courses/Day1/Lecture3) introduces the python gadget and the ismsmrd-python-toolboxes that contains various toolboxes dedicated to common issues. Its different submodules correspond to different applications, such as fourier transfrom, grappa reconstruction, etc.

### 1.4 - Q&A


## 2. MRD, a vendor-agnostic file format for MRI reconstruction (or toward the scanner room)   (day 2: June 18th)

### 2.1 - Title  (  )

This [lesson](Courses/Day2/Lecture1) introduces the ISMSMRD format

**See also**:

  * [ismrmrd](https://ismrmrd.github.io/)

### 2.2 - Siemens/GE/Bruker raw data conversion to MRD through XML style sheets, and working with HDF5 files

This session discusses how the conversion process in ISMRMRD utilizes style sheets to convert the vendors' proprietary formats and data values to the fully and openly documented ISMRMRD format.  There will also be an interactive demonstration of working with HDF5 files in a Jupyter notebook environment with
Python 3.

**See also**:

  * [HDF5 for Python](https://www.h5py.org)
  * [Juypter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)

### 2.3 - Communication process with the Siemens scanner

This course servers an introduction to the IceGadgetron software. The main functinality of IceGadgetron is to stream siemens MR kspace data to MRD formant and send data to Gadgetron. As Gadgetron reconstructed images and send images back to scanner, IceGadgetron will receive the images and pass them down the functor chain. In this way, the inline processing is achieved, which allows seamless integration of Gadgetron to MR scanner and be used by non-technical users.

### 4.2 - Generic Recon in Gadgetron  (  )

This [lesson](Course/Day4/Lecture2) introduces the generic reconstruction concept and implemenation in Gadgetron. The generic recon is first an idea to develop a systematic handling of multi-dimension kspace MR data and implemented most commonly used technique to support multiple imaging protocols. The key idea is the "on-the-fly" triggering and reconstruction.

The key components include data triggering, data bucket organization, auto-calibration data preparation, coil compression, reconstruction, kspace filter, partial fourier handling, and FOV adjustment gadgets. User can specify which dimension to trigger (e.g. for a multi-slice cine scan, triggering can be done with SLICE dimension). In this way, the reconstruction can start after data from one slice is acquired, instead of waiting to the end of scan. After triggering, every data bucket was processed in a uniformed manner and each encoding space is handled separately. 

The corresponding gadgets also server as good starting point for user to overload for their own use cases, if the generic chain may not handle a specific use case.

### 4.3 - Call AI model in Gadgetron (  )

This [lesson](Courses/Day4/Lecture3) introduces the topic of neural network model in Gadgetron. 

[The introduction of AI model into Gadgetron](http://archive.ismrm.org/2019/4837.html) is a recent development, but of great importance to improve imaging, computing, analysis and reporting. First, Gadgetron offers ability for user to load their pre-trained AI models and apply models to incoming kspace and imaging data. Second usecase of Gadgetron to support AI is to allow user to do inline training and apply resulting model to incoming data (e.g. check the Grappa_AI example, where a [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) implemention of Grappa reconstruction was demonstrated).

User can choose to implement AI functionalities in python gadgets or in python functions which can be called in C++ gadgets.
