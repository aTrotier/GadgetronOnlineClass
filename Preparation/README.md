We would be very happy if you could spend a couple of minutes of your time to have a look at the Code of Conduct to make sure we all are taking responsibility to look after each other and make sure we are contributing towards an inclusive and supportive community. Please do have a look at and let us know if you have any questions regarding it. All toolkit participants are responsible to follow the rules listed here, as well as making sure that everyone in the toolkit follows it.
We have adopted the code of conduct of (fieldtriptoolbox)[http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/toolkit2020/code_of_conduct/]. 

If you feel any other concerns regarding any disruptive and unacceptable behavior of the others regarding the composure of the discussions please immediately contact the Gadgetron Organizers (valery dot ozenne at u-bordeaux .fr and david dot hansen at gradientsoftware.net) or any of the Speakers.
