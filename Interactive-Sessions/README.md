# Interactive-Session

Originally named "bring your twix data", this session was designed to help the participants to deal with their kspace data. While *ISMRMRD* and *Gadgetron* covers many generic reconstructions like cartesian, radial, sprial, lots of implementations (less standard or more recent) are lacking. Additionnaly, suitable conversion of kspace data from main MRI vendor format is possible but some modification might be needed for new sequence.

If you need some help to convert and organize your kspace data before working on your reconstruction, Interactive-Session is a good place to start. 


## How to participate ?

* Step 1: upload your data to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

* Step 2: open an [issue](https://github.com/gadgetron/GadgetronOnlineClass/issues) that describe your submission. Please follow the template of the first issue mentionning:
    
    - Title : 
    - Original article (if exist) 
    - Kspace URL : 
    - Code URL () : at least of preliminary version will be a plus 
    - Expected difficulty or confidence in success : easy / medium / difficult low / medium / hight
    - Description (5 lines) : 


* Step 3: Work in progress session about 1 or 2h will be organized with experience users of Ismrmrd and Gadgetron to help you managing the kspace data or answer your question. 

* Step 4:
