# Lecture 2 : Practical Introduction to Gadgetron [WiP]Title : Practical Introduction to GadgetronSchedule : June 11, 2020 | 15:00-16:00 Speaker: Kristoffer Langeland Knudsen## Summary - [Running Gadgetron Reconstructions]
   - [The Gadgetron Server] Introduction to the Gadgetron process. 
   - [The Gadgetron Client] Introduction to the Gadgetron MRD client in particular, and MRD clients in general. 
   - [Controlling Gadgetron]
     - [Creating a Config File]
     - [DEMO: Running a reconstruction.] 
       - [Introduce 'The Dataset'] A fully sampled Cartesian dataset. We'll use it throughout the lecture to demo Gadget functionality. 
       - [Introduce 'The Config File'] A minimal reconstruction. We'll build on it throughout the lecture as we demo Gadget functionality.
       - [Introduce 'Acquisition'] Light introduction of the 'Acquisition' concept, and how it fits in the Gadgetron Environment.      
     - [Common Config File Structure] Config files commonly weaves data from k-space through image-space, with a variety of processing steps in between. 
 - [AccumulateTriggerGadget]
   - [Introduction to AccumulateTriggerGadget's Functionality]
   - [DEMO: AccumulateTriggerGadget] Update minimal reconstruction to accumulate AcquisitionBuckets from Acquisitions.
     - [Introduce 'AcquisitionBucket'] Light introduction of the 'AcquisitionBucket' concept.
