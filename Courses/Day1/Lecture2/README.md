# Lecture 1.2 : Practical Introduction to Gadgetron

Title : Practical Introduction to Gadgetron

Schedule : June 11, 2020 | 14:30-15:30 

Speaker: Kristoffer Langeland Knudsen

This lecture is intended as a very practical introduction, covering the basics of running and controlling Gadgetron. The lecture is structured around a demo, in which a reconstruction is assembled piece by piece. 

As the demo progresses, the lecture will take a series of shallow dives into the functionality of Gadgets as they make an appearance in the reconstruction. Common Datatypes will also be covered.
