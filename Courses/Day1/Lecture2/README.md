Title : Practical Introduction to Gadgetron

Schedule : June 11, 2020 | 14:30-15:30 

Speaker: Kristoffer Langeland Knudsen

This lecture is intended as a very practical introduction, covering the basics of running and controlling Gadgetron. The lecture is structured around a demo, in which a reconstruction is assembled piece by piece. 

As the demo progresses, the lecture will take a series of shallow dives into the functionality of Gadgets as they make an appearance in the reconstruction. Common Datatypes will also be covered.  

The materials used during the demo (including visualization script) can be found here:
